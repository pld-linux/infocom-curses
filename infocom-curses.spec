%description
As "Curses" opens, you're hunting about in the attic of your family
home, looking for a tatty old map of Paris (you're going on holiday
tomorrow) and generally trying to avoid all the packing. Aunt Jemima
is potting daisies and sulking; the attics are full of endless
distractions and secrets; Greek myths, horoscopes, sixth-century
politics, a less than altogether helpful demon, a mysterious bomb
plot, photography, ritual, poetry and a dream or two all get in your
way; and somehow you keep being reminded of your family through the
ages, and all its Curses...

...could it be that even you are Cursed?
